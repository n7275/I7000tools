# IBM 7000 tools.

This is a collection of tools I have developed over the years for working with
7 track tapes, and punch card decks for various IBM 7000 series machines.  

* listtape.c is a program for dumping 7 track tapes. It includes translation for
IBM BCD, Burroughs BCI, CDC Display Code, Univac code.

* mkbcdtape.c is a program that will convert an ascii file to BCD format.

* mkdeck.c is a program that will combine various card decks to produce a master deck.

* dprint.c is a program to display decks graphically in ASCII format.
